Prologue:
As a little kid growing up I remember
how I always played with paperplanes
The sensational tingeling I felt when I saw my plane
moving in the air... higher and higher
I guess those feeling led me to the path I walked for a while
I needed to get high... so I could fly in the sky

Would you like to take a trip with me
To the end of the universe?
It is not impossible at all
Just set your course
Let your imagination fly
And be there everyday
Deep inside your memories of fantasies
Everything can be for real

Flying in the sky
There's a reason I know why
Flying in the sky
There's a reason babe, I know why

We are traveling in our minds to places
we can be alone
To look at suns and stars from here
and feel ourselves at home
Could we dance together in
the clouds where we belong?
Could we dream and search new worlds
and live this fantasy?

Flying in the sky
There's a reason I know why
Flying in the sky
There's a reason babe, I know why
Flying in the sky
There's a reason we know why
Flying in the sky
We're falling in love, you and I
