We're flying in the sky
Hey, baby, please don't cry

I came to Holland, but now it's Nederlands
There always party and everybody dance
I met a girl, my god I fell in love
She looked at me, I think it's not enough

We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
Just give me one more try
We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
(Just give me one more try)

Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
We're flying in the sky
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
And now you should to cry

Please stop, just listen me
Hard to explain, okay
I didn't know your real name
This chemistry is killing me and we are all to blame

We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
Please baby tell me why
We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
Please baby tell me why

Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
We're flying in the sky
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
Ай-яй-яй
And now you should to cry

We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
Please baby tell me why
We're hiding from the light
And dancing through the night
But you said me goodbye
Please baby tell me why
